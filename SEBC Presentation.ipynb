What you see here is the design alternatives for a \"3D printed\" steel bridge in Amsterdam.  This is one of the cases where robotics and 3D printers overlap, I'll come back to this.  The automation software used (Project Dreamcatcher) to create these designs was developed by Autodesk, the makers of AutoCAD and Revit.  The software is given the geometric parameters and load characteristics and uses an iterative design approach, adding and removing material until the structure is optimized.  The one that was ultimately chosen is the branching structure in the upper left.  Since I don't want to run out of time covering 3D printing, and I also want to have time for questions at the end, we'll pick this up later when I talk more about the robotics overlap."

    "Filament printers work by feeding a plastic line through a heating element and placing it a layer at a time on the print bed.  The simplicity of the design and low cost of this type of printer has made it popular among hobbyists.  This type of printing also shares one of the flaws common to many 3D printers, having anisotropic strength characteristics.  The layering leads to natural weak points in the final product.  This is partially dealt with by remelting the previous layer of material.  Though the resulting printed objects can be surprisingly strong but it still leaves the a less than perfect finish.  However, with a quick look I found the MP Select Mini, the OneUP and Prusa i3 printers all available below \\$200.  Granted the Prusa i3 is on sale but in December the OneUp was only printer at that price.  Since this type is both inexpensive and easy to operate you should expect to see one of them in your homes and offices soon.  As a side note, one of the reasons you see so many of these 3D printers is the development of the open source movement and the release of the Arduino development platform.  This is also a topic I will come back to."

The normal binder method would uses a chemical reaction to bind the powder material together, which is then built up layer by layer.  When using a binder the result is anisotropic, as before.  This fusion method has similar problems with layers of residual stresses, but ASTM is working with America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute, to develop a new standard to address these problems.  The result will be a standard that will allow for designing around this issue."

    "Joseph DeSimone (and others) at Carbon3D have developed the Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) printing technique that creates objects without the problematic layering of other methods.  For those of you who have not heard of it, the way CLIP works is a liquid polymer that is cured with the aid of ultraviolet light projected from below as a cross sectional image of the object.  Unlike previous methods using ultraviolet light CLIP prevents the polymer from adhering to the window at the bottom by using an oxygen-permeable membrane which retards the curing process.  The result is a very rapidly printed object built up from the molecular level making it isotropic, without weak planes.  The polymer can be modified chemically so that the end result can have almost any physical property desired, and at a rate 10 to 100 times faster than previous methods.  The developer has even boasted that it may reach speeds of 1000 times faster.  The requirements for making a 3D print using CLIP are the size of the pool and the number of projectors it is conceivable that this may make its way to construction sites for fabrication of building parts."

    "This is the first construction printer I'm going to talk about that uses traditional construction material.  Designed by Russian engineers it serves as an entry level 3D printer, small, lightweight, and low power consumption (8 KW).  According to their site the concrete printer takes on 30 minutes to setup, it is self leveling and when not in use can fit through a 3 foot wide opening.  It is designed to be places in the center of a house where it prints the surrounding structure.  For multi story structures a crane is required to move from one floor to the next.  The other limitation is the print area, the radial reach is only about 26 feet giving a maximum print area of approximately 2,000 square feet.  However it can be used to print foundation forms and does some initial finishing of the wall surfaces.  A skip trowel finish is suggested for the final appearance.  The nice part about using concrete for a print material is that as it cures the crystalline structure between layers grows together making it much smaller issue.  Additionally if more strength is required the structure can be treated like a block building and some of the cells can be grouted solid.  They are reporting costs savings of 40% and a rapid build time.  "

Wanting to accomplish these lofty goals are part of the reason other designs that copy his work have made it to market first.  Contour Crafting printers are supposed to be available within a few years though and they are the only ones with plans for larger scale buildings being printed on-site at the moment.  Apartment complexes are to be rapidly printed with the use of multiple printers working side by side; high-rises are planned to be constructed with printers that climb the walls as they print. With not only the structure but the plumbing and electrical being placed by the printer it may become the replacement for whole construction crews."

That being said, they are producing attractive structures now and are exporting 20,000 smaller buildings to the Egyptian government.  The is a fair amount of controversy with their printing process though since Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis's former student apparently stoled it.  I don't know how this will play out if they try to actually set up a factory in the US, but they have expressed the desire to do so.  They may just be waiting until the patents expire in ten more years.  Either way, their process requires connecting the walls together with conventionally poured concrete.

The construction speed was significantly faster than their conventional construction methods similar office buildings. The method cut the labor cost by more than 50 per cent compared to conventional buildings of approximately the same size.  Specifically, they are estimating that using this technique, production times are reduced by 50 to 70 percent, labor costs can be reduced by 50 to 80 percent, and construction waste is reduced by 30 to 60 percent."

    "Dutch designer Joris Laarman, whose R&D company MX3D, developed a steel printing robot with the goal of printing bridges (and other things).  This technique is actually built up weld.  Being built up it does have a layered structure but being made from steel allows these layers to be oriented in whatever is the most advantageous or at least the least detrimental.  The layers can be made to be perpendicular to the direction of load reducing the strength requirements.  It is also a very efficient way of building a structure since there only needs to be the material required for support with no waste.  Unfortunately this is not a particularly fast process placing a single drop at a time but the potential exists for greater speed, and as increased construction time does not equate to increased labor costs this is not necessarily a deal breaker for custom designs."

    "The International Association for Automation and Robotics in construction has been around since 1984.  During their first conference, talks were covering tunneling robots, robotic assembly, and management tools for robotic construction projects.  In 2015 there were topics covering from automated kitchens for assisted living to assistive bathroom modules.  The Robotics and Mechatronics Conference in Japan had presentations covering wearable robots, swarm robots, and Construction & Infrastructure Maintenance Robotics.  My point is automation will rapidly be permeating all aspects of construction be it 3D printers, robotic construction workers, or just the internet of things.  This was even evident back in 1985 when this chart was published.  I would have to say we are a little farther along than was expected."

In the upper left there is an autonomous version of a Hitachi dump truck is scheduled to be available in 2017. It is designed to either work independently or as part of a fleet of trucks. This particular version is targeted at the mining industry but other versions are being developed for construction sites.  Top center is a human robotic platform (HRP) in teleoperation task on construction machine as part of the NEDO Humnoid Project.  It may be a little hard to see but the upper right is a set of photos from Sekisui Chemical Co., LTD which can produce 1,000 homes a year in their automated plant.  Lower left is the Semi-Autonomous Mason (SAM) from Construction Robotics.  Bottom center is Hadrain, from Perth, Australia, which can lay 1000 bricks per hour.

If you feel a little more hands on and want to strike out on your own, the open-source movement (Arduino (\\$25), Raspberry Pi (\\$35), etc.) has made the barrier to entry into the robotics field extremely low, practically non-existent.  There are projects out there that will provide a leg up like the 7Bot arm (\\$350) that learns motion instead of programming it.  You can even get your kids to build something.  There are numerous resources available on-line that can be used to build a useful robot without the need of an engineering degree, but it may take some time."
